**SypherLang Usage Guide**

**1. Setting Up Your Environment**

To begin using SypherLang, you need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and your environment configured properly. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Begin by cloning the SypherLang repository from GitHub:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SypherCoRe/SypherLang.git
   cd SypherLang
   ```

2. **Install Python and Dependencies**
   
   SypherLang is developed in Python. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required dependencies using `pip` by executing:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Docker Installation (Optional)**

   For a more complex and scalable execution environment, SypherLang supports execution in Docker. You may use Docker to run blockchain nodes or other isolated processes.

   Install Docker if you have not done so:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
   ```

**2. Running SypherLang Code**

SypherLang allows you to execute both basic and advanced smart contract examples. Here are the steps to run SypherLang programs:

1. **Execute SypherLang Examples**

   The examples can be found in the `examples/` directory. You can run these examples to understand the core capabilities of SypherLang.

   ```sh
   python interpreter.py examples/example1.sypher
   python interpreter.py examples/example2.sypher
   ```

   - `example1.sypher`: This file contains a basic demonstration of setting up a privacy contract.
   - `example2.sypher`: This file provides a more advanced example, including quantum-resistant cryptographic operations and concurrent executions.

**3. Writing and Executing Custom SypherLang Programs**

To create your own SypherLang programs:

1. **Create Your Sypher File**
   
   Use any text editor to create a `.sypher` file. You can use the SypherLang syntax to define privacy contracts, concurrent operations, and quantum-resistant logic.

   Example:

   ```
   function main() {
       let data = encrypt("Hello World");
       prove_privacy(data);
       execute_parallel();
   }
   ```

2. **Run Your Custom Program**

   Save your file as `my_program.sypher`. Run it using the SypherLang interpreter:

   ```sh
   python interpreter.py my_program.sypher
   ```

**4. Using the IDE**

1. **Launch the IDE**

   The SypherLang IDE can be launched from the command line:

   ```sh
   python sypherlang_ide.py
   ```

   This custom-built IDE provides a graphical interface to write, execute, and test your smart contracts and SypherLang code efficiently.

2. **IDE Features**

   - **Syntax Highlighting**: The IDE provides an enhanced interface with syntax highlighting for privacy contracts, quantum operations, and concurrent programming constructs.
   - **Code Autocomplete**: It also includes an autocomplete feature to speed up writing of SypherLang code.
   - **Execution**: You can run and debug your code directly within the IDE.

**5. Deploying on Blockchain**

1. **Set Up Blockchain Nodes**

   To deploy your SypherLang contracts, you can set up nodes using Docker, or use an external hosting provider such as Linode or Digital Ocean.

2. **Genesis Block**

   You need to create and launch your blockchain's genesis block before deploying the contracts. You can execute the following commands for the setup:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name sypher_blockchain -p 8545:8545 sypher_blockchain_image
   ```

   Once the blockchain is running, you can deploy your contracts to the main network.

**6. Common Commands and Scripts**

- **Compiling Code**: Use the compiler to compile SypherLang code into bytecode.
  
  ```sh
  python compiler/compiler.py my_program.sypher
  ```

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Use the `zkp.py` in the privacy_contracts directory to verify zero-knowledge proofs.
  
  ```sh
  python privacy_contracts/zkp.py --verify my_proof.json
  ```

- **Parallel Execution**: You can execute specific blocks of code concurrently using `parallel_exec.py` from the concurrency folder.

  ```sh
  python concurrency/parallel_exec.py
  ```

**7. Helpful Tips**

- **Error Handling**: Make sure that your `.sypher` files have consistent and valid syntax. The IDE can help flag errors before execution.
- **Explore Examples**: It is advisable to look through the example files to understand complex constructs and privacy contracts.
- **Quantum Safety**: The `quantum_resistance` folder contains lattice-based cryptographic methods that can be used for enhanced security. Use these to ensure that your contracts are safe against quantum attacks.

**8. Git Integration**

If you are making changes or collaborating with others, use Git to track changes and collaborate effectively:

1. **Add Remote**: Make sure you have your GitHub repository linked.
   
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/SypherCoRe/SypherLang.git
   ```

2. **Push Changes**:
   
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**9. Running in Docker (Optional)**

You can use Docker to containerize the execution of SypherLang programs:

- **Build Docker Image**:
  
  ```sh
  docker build -t sypherlang_image .
  ```

- **Run Container**:
  
  ```sh
  docker run -it sypherlang_image python interpreter.py examples/example1.sypher
  ```

**10. Support**

For additional help or questions, please refer to the GitHub Issues section or the `README.md` in the GitHub repository. You can also join the community forums to connect with other users and developers.

**Conclusion**

SypherLang provides powerful tools for developing secure and private smart contracts. By following this guide, you should be able to run, create, and deploy your own SypherLang programs effectively. Always ensure that you keep your environment up to date and leverage the built-in IDE for efficient development.
